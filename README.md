# Management-project

The Main aim of the Blood Bank Management system is to ease the process of blood donation and allowance at the blood bank. The blood bank management system aims to fulfil the gap between blood donors and doctors. When a blood donor gets an easy and suitable platform to register and donate blood, it becomes easier for many people who wish to donate blood but cannot find a proper platform for it due to their busy schedules.
It is a web application created using Html, CSS, JavaScript. This application will be responsive. For the backend we have used MySQL. For linking both frontend and backend we have used PHP. There will be separate login for hospitals and users. When the patient needs blood, doctors can easily check the blood group available and provide it to the blood receiver. The percentage of people donating blood is increasing day by day due to awareness to donate blood for those needed. The blood received must be managed thoroughly so that there will be no negative effect on the blood receiver once they received blood.
